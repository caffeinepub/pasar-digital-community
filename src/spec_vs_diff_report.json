  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented via a new /revoke-ownership route, an AppHeader nav item, and a Dashboard quick action that routes into a vehicle-selection + PIN-gated revoke flow. REQ-3 is partially evidenced (post-registration navigation to Vehicle Detail is added), but the diff summary does not clearly show the required explicit 'View Details' affordance on each vehicle in the vehicles list. The diff also includes several unrelated/unrequested changes (i18n/provider wiring, PWA/service worker/manifest edits, admin/profile/about/auth refactors), including modifications to files listed as immutable in the constraints.",

      "reason": "The VehiclesPage.tsx diff excerpt is truncated before the vehicle list rendering, and the visible portion does not show any per-vehicle \"View Details\" UI or navigation to `/vehicles/$vehicleId`.
