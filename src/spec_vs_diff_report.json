  "summary": "Frontend changes implement principal-scoped React Query keys for vehicle queries, add explicit cache invalidation and immediate cache updates after register/revoke mutations, and improve revoke-ownership error messaging in English. Backend changes are present but truncated, so backend-side correctness for revoke identifier handling/removal cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. A version bump and changelog entry indicate a new build release intent, but actual build publication/quality gate results are not evidenced in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Fix the ownership revocation flow end-to-end (including backend) so it no longer fails due to mismatched identifiers; backend should remove the vehicle record on successful revocation.",
      "reason": "Although the frontend now calls revoke with a vehicleId and provides clearer English error messages, the backend implementation changes relevant to identifier matching and record removal are not visible/confirmable because backend/main.mo is truncated and the revoke logic is not shown in the diff summary.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Produce and publish a new build and ensure quality gates (typecheck/lint/format) pass, with manual verification of the specified flows.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a version bump and changelog entry, but does not provide evidence of an actual build artifact being generated/published or that CI/quality gates and manual verification were performed.",
