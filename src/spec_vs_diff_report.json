  "summary": "REQ-56 (startup retry flow) appears to be implemented via a new/updated StartupBootstrapError screen and a useActorBootstrapStatus hook that removes/cancels cached actor queries and triggers refetch. REQ-55 is primarily an operational rebuild/redeploy outcome and cannot be verified from the provided code diff; additionally, the diff includes multiple functional/product changes beyond a rebuild-only redeploy, and it modifies files that were explicitly constrained as immutable.",

      "requirement": "Trigger a rebuild and redeploy of the existing application (no functional changes required) to restart the stopped backend canister causing IC0508.",
      "reason": "The diff shows code changes but does not include any deployment/redeploy configuration or evidence that a rebuild/redeploy was executed successfully or that IC0508 is resolved post-deploy. This requirement is primarily operational and is not demonstrable from the diff summary.",

      "reason": "The diff introduces multiple changes that look like new/expanded product behavior (PWA/service worker, admin pages, about page, branding/copy changes, profile editing), which goes beyond what is necessary solely to validate a redeploy recovery.",
