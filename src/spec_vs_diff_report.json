  "summary": "REQ-2 (frontend onboarding error handling) appears implemented in `frontend/src/hooks/useOnboarding.ts` by mapping authorization-related backend errors to friendly English messages and avoiding exposing the raw backend string. REQ-1 (backend onboarding role assignment fix) is not evidenced in the provided truncated `backend/main.mo` diff. Additionally, the diff summary indicates multiple unrelated frontend changes and modifications to files that were explicitly constrained as immutable.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix backend onboarding so a normal user completing onboarding with a valid invite token can be assigned the `#user` role without requiring admin privileges, and without trapping with `Unauthorized: Only admins can assign user roles`. Keep existing allowlisted first-admin claim behavior.",
      "reason": "The provided `backend/main.mo` diff excerpt shows new helper functions (e.g., `hasAdminPermission`) and existing admin checks (e.g., `generateInviteCode`), but does not include any visible change to `completeOnboarding` logic or role assignment that would prevent the `Only admins can assign user roles` trap for normal users. Because the relevant section is truncated, there is insufficient evidence the requirement is implemented.",

      "reason": "These features are not requested by REQ-1/REQ-2 and are outside the stated scope (only onboarding authorization + onboarding error message mapping).",
