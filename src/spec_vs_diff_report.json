However, required static image assets (uploaded logo and generated PWA icons) are not evidenced as added, and non-admin access denial for all admin routes (esp. Admin Dashboard) cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "The code references `/assets/Logo Pasar Digital Community-1.png` via `AppLogo`, but the diff summary does not show the actual image file being added to `frontend/public/assets` (or equivalent). Also, no evidence is shown that onboarding page(s) were updated to render the logo.",
