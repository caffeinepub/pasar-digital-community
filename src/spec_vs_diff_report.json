  "summary": "Diff addresses the loading/auth bootstrap with a new AuthGate flow, adds an authenticated-profile error UI with retry, and adjusts layout/header rendering. However, the profile data flow still relies on a placeholder role-based workaround rather than the real backend caller profile API, and several unrelated features (PWA, About/Admin enhancements) were added beyond the stated scope.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Fix the caller profile data flow to use the real backend profile API (not placeholder role-based data), and ensure onboarding redirects only happen after the profile fetch has definitively completed.",
      "reason": "The profile hook explicitly uses getCallerUserRole and returns a placeholder UserProfile (empty fields) to infer onboarding, stating that getCallerUserProfile is not exposed/used. The diff summary does not show corresponding backend/main.mo changes to expose a real getCallerUserProfile implementation, and the Profile/Header continue to consume this placeholder data.",
